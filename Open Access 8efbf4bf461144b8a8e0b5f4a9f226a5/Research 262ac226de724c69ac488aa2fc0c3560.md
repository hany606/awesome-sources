> Cooperation is one of the most difficult elements to get right in multi-agent models such as those powered by reinforcement learning techniques. Effective cooperation dynamics in multi-agent have two main dimensions:
> 
> 
> *1)* *What levels of cooperation is needed for an agent to be effective?*
> 
> *2)* *Which are the right agents to cooperate with?*

> A key challenge in the study of multiagent cooperation is the need for individual
> agents not only to cooperate effectively, but to decide with whom to cooperate.
