If you have a passion for space applications, and you are a hardware or software wizard (or you are very willing to learn), drop us a line at mailto:join@mistlab.ca. We often have positions available for PhD and Master's studies in computer engineering, and we are most likely looking for interns. We always welcome spontaneous applications, whether you want to get a PhD degree or just work on a project.
