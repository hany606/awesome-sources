# Universities

This is a copy from the original table with partial information as this information was personal for me and my preferences. The list of the universities is mostly relevant to my interests, therefore, it might not be suitable for everyone. Thus, I have kept only the list of names.

The original list includes: priority, interest level (preference), acceptance realistic PoV, labs, people (researchers, professors, some students) associated with the university

Also, it is not updated, it can differ from the year I applied in (Fall 2021)
 
My own keywords: Robot Learning, multi-agent system, multi-robotic system, RL, sim2real, Aeronautics and Astronautics, CS, Engineering, aerial vehicles, dynamic, and control system
