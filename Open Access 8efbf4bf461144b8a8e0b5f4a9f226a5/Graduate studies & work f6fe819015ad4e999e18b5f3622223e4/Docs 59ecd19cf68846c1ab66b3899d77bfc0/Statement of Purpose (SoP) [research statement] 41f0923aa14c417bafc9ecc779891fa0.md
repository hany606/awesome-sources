## SoP:

> A Statement of Purpose is an essay stating the purpose of applying for a particular course in a particular university. This essay consists of a gist of who you are, who you want to become, and how ready you are to pursue a certain course in an institution.

# Core:

- Solid achievements → Show promise of your success in graduate study
- Self-motivation, competence, potential as a graduate student. (Between the lines)
- Write in Active not passive voice
- Demonstrate everything by example; don’t say directly that you’re a persistent person, show it.
- If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance despite obstacles. You can elaborate more in your personal statement.
- Avoid common clichés in your SoP. In particular, try to avoid childhood anecdotes or goals. The admissions committee is interested in your current goals, skills, and strengths.
- be concise in your writing and get straight to the point. Write in a plain language and use your own words. Be sincere. Use a spell and grammar checker.
- Be authentic
- Why do you wish to study in this grad school?
- What research you have done?
- What research do you hope to do?
- Why do you like research?
- The area of research
- The SOP document should only be 1-3 pages.
- Relate your past and present experiences to the future
- PhD
    - Why doing research in your chosen field is important to you
    - Why do you are committed to doing a Ph.D.?
    - What do you hope to do with it?
    - If your background is unusual, tell us about it and how it bears on your Ph.D. plans. This section can provide useful context, but keep it relatively short; spend most of your time on the research you've done and what you hope to do in the future.
    - Tell us about the research you have done
        - Tell us about the research you have done, if any. We want to know that you can describe the problem you confronted, argue that it is important and was challenging to solve, compare (briefly) to prior work, and explain your technical solution and how you validated it at a high-level. Doing this in a short essay is hard, but if you can do so effectively it's a very good sign for research.
    - Tell us about some problem you are interested in
        - Tell us about some problem you are interested in. It doesn't have to be the only problem you want to work on, but it should be a good scientific problem. You should explain what is the scientific question, why it is important, why it is hard, and why it is open. You might give some ideas for an approach to solving it, though characterizing the problem well is often critical. This gives us an idea of what you might do in graduate school and gives us additional insight into your readiness for research.
    - Tell us the general areas you are interested in.
        - This is your opportunity to show you are interested in more than just the problem above, if you are.
- We simply don’t care what you did as a child, and we don’t believe you either.

# 1. Introduction

- Introduce myself
- Interest and goals
- Desires and dreams
- Introduce the general research field that you are interested in.
- Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests, and motivations
    - interests, the spark of desire for graduate study → Short, concise, to the point

# 2&3. Background

- Past research
- Projects
- Papers
- Work
- Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
    - Past research → with whom, title, my responsibilities and the outcome
    - Important paper or thesis project you completed→ anything scholarly beyond your curricular requirements.
    - Work experience →testing, designing, researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.
- Tell us what you found, what you learned, what approaches you tried

# 4&5. Why and How?

- What to study?
- Why to study a graduate degree?
- Area of research interests
- Why you wish to do what you wish to do
- Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
    - If you graduated and worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what you’ve been doing: company or non-profit, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.
- Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests
    - What you would like to study in grad school? In enough details → Make them convinced that you understand the scope of research in their discipline and are engaged with current research themes
    - Area of your interests, pose a question, define a problem or indicate a theme that you would like to address, and questions that arise from contemporary research. This should be an ample (generous or more than adequate in size, scope, or capacity) paragraph!
    - Are there professors whose research interests parallel yours? If so, indicate this
    - Check the specific program; many may require you to name a professor or professors with whom you might work.
    - End your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the challenges ahead of you.
