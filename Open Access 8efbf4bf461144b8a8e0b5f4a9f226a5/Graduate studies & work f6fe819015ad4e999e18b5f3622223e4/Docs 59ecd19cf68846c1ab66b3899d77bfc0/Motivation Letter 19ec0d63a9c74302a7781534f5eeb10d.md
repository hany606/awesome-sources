# Motivation Letter

The SOP is not addressed to any specific person or department, it is drafted in an essay format, whereas, the motivational letter is always addressed to a professor or department under whose guidance you will be studying. The motivation letter allows to you be in direct contact with the professor/department, hence, you should always aim to highlight points that make you stand out of the crowd, especially for PhD aspirants.
