# Subject:

[Inquiry from potential graduate applicant]

# Body:

Interest, research before, patience and optimism

(a) introduce yourself, (b) inquire about whether they are taking students, (c) make it clear why you are interested in that particular faculty member, and (d) get any advice they might offer.

- Which class → university, degree, track
- Which work → thesis, interest, supervisor
- Focus interest, attach CV
- Willing, planning, looking forward to apply to .... this Fall
- Interested in your work, in your lab
- Read your papers, similar papers, read his research, seminar, tutorial
    - Mention a paper or a research project you saw on the professor’s website. You don’t need details; just show that you’ve done your homework and are truly interested in that individual.
- Asking about if there are available opportunities in your lab, scholarships
- I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.
- Do your homework! Mention one of the professor's paper
- [Possibly add a few more lines here about your background and interests.]
    - It’s useful to include some details about yourself—where you got or are getting your degree, what kind of research experience you’ve had, and/or what you’ve been doing since you graduated.
    - (e.g., “I did internships in a neuroscience lab working with rodents and a social psychology lab administering questionnaires”). But if this experience is very different from the intended mentor’s research, you need to make it clear that you’re planning to move in a different direction for your graduate work.
- Thank you

You should include these things, but use more precise labels like “Manuscripts in Progress, Manuscripts in preparation”, “Conference Presentations, Unpublished manuscript, Manuscript submitted for publication”, etc.”
