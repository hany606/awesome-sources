# Knowledge base (Motion Planning) (WIP)

# Description

This document includes the current progress of my literature review on motion planning (Just started a month ago).

The comments and the notes are just descriptions for me, you can disregard it for now.

Also, there is a PDF with quotes from the papers but it is still in progress, for now, this document lists only the list of papers to read, only prioritized with the relevance of this paper to my research interest after a quick skim.

This document is not a complete/full document, it is just a part of the original one
