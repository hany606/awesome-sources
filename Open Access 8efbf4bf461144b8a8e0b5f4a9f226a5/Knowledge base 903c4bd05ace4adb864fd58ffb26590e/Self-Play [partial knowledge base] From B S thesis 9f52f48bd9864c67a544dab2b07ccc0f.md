# Self-Play [Partial knowledge base] from B.S. thesis

I will share the whole knowledge base but hopefully after getting an acceptance for a publication soon, inshallah!

This table includes the resources for this certain literature, formatted in such a way to be organized. Version: 00.00.0000

We want to understand the following:
- Open problems in multi-agent reinforcement learning domain:
   * Sparse/dense, local/global(shared)/different rewards (credit assignment)
   * Open multi-agent system
   * Limited observations (partial observable MDP)
   * Cherry picking results (How to choose the best results to use)
   * Non-stationarity
   * Curse of dimensionality
   * Global expiration
   * Relative overgeneralization
   * Scaling
   * Hyperparameters tunning
   * Computational demands
   * Reproducibility

- Research directions in MARL
   * Learning communication
   * Learning cooperation
   * Self-play
   * Analysis of emergent behaviors
   * Agents modeling agents
———————————————————————
- Algorithm for training
- Methods and ways for analysis
- Limitations of self-play methods
   * Open problem to improve the efficiency in sampling and memory consumption (Ad parallel training)
   * Implementation challenges and hyperparameters tunning
   * Reproducibility
- Advantages of self-play methods (Why people are using self-play?)
   * Impressive results
- History of self-play
   * Old?
   * Bansal et al.
   * Dota2
   * Google + Deepmind
   * Facebook boxers
   * Deepmind paper?
- What are the current problems in self-play field:
    * Adaptive non-stationarity problem
    * No formal models/methods for self-play
    * (How do certain algorithms maintain self=play compatibility while also guaranteeing safety against adversarial players,          
       and optimality against stochastic ones?
    * No definition of optimal (What is optimal?)
