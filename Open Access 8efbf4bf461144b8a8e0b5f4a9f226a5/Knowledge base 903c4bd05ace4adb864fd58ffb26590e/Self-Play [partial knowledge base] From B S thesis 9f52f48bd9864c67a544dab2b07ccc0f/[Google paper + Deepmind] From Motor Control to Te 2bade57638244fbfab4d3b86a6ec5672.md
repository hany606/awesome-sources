# [Google paper + Deepmind] From Motor Control to Team Play in
Simulated Humanoid Football

*Evaluation of performance: Elo-score

Evaluate against benchmark, human, specific evaluation agents

Counterfactual Policy Divergence: We use the counterfactual policy divergence (CPD) technique (47) to measure the extent to which the behaviour of a player is influenced by different objectss in the football scene (ball, teammate, opponent). We measure the KL-divergence induced in the policy by repositioning (or changing the velocity) of a single object
*Opponent selection + Training: Select the opponents randomly
Importance: 8

Notes: It does not cover a lot on self-play concept

Their method seems to have population of agents and then train using self-play then mutate and get the offspring from the results

Outer (Sefl-play) and inner learning loop
Status: Done, Read it again!
