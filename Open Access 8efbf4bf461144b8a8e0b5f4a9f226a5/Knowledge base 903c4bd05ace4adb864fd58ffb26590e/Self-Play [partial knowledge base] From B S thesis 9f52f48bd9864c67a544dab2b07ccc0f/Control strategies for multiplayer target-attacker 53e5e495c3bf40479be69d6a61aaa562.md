Notes: They are using non-learning based methods → optimal control and optimzation methods with some assumptions like the information that the agents posses and the dynamic model of the agents

According to “Neural Tree Expansion for Multi-Robot Planning in Non-Cooperative Environments” This paper is the SoTA for such games.
