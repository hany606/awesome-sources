# [DeepMind - CTF] Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning

Importance: 10
Notes: Interesting work
Explains and removes a lot of assumptions made previously in others work → independent agents, local information, only from pixels

CTF → Capture The Flag

Some interesting things about game theoretical solutions

Cool work about the sparse reward and how they solved with meta learning somehow as far as I understand
