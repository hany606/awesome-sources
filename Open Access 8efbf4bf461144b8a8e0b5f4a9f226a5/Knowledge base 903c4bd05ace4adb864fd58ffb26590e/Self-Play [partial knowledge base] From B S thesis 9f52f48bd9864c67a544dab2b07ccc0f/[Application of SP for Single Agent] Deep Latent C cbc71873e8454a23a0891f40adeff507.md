# [Application of SP for Single Agent]  Deep Latent Competition: Learning to Race Using Visual Control Policies in Latent Space

Importance: 3
Notes: Interesting paper
It uses self-play as a method to make single-agent RL trains better. Good idea to test and check the performance.

Treat single-agent RL as a multi-agent self-play (Imagine that you are competing with someone) Think about HER, CER (COMPETITIVE EXPERIENCE REPLAY) as well
