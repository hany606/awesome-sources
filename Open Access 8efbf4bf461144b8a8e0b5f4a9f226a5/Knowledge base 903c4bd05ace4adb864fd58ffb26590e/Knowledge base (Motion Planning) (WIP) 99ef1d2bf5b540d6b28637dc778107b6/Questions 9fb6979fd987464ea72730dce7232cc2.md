# What is Motion Planning problem?

> **Motion planning**
> 
> 
> Given the observations and the predictions of the dynamic actors around the self-driving vehicle, as well as the static constructs provided by HD maps, the problem of motion planning is to efficiently solve for the trajectory the self-driving vehicle will follow.

# Which datasets are used to benchmark the methods?

**Closed loop evaluation: At each time step, we predict the future trajectory and then move the AV accordingly**

> For motion prediction datasets, check [https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chen_ScePT_Scene-Consistent_Policy-Based_Trajectory_Predictions_for_Planning_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chen_ScePT_Scene-Consistent_Policy-Based_Trajectory_Predictions_for_Planning_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)
