# Learning

These sources, I have collected them through the years. Unfortunately, they are not very organized ðŸ˜ž

If you like to organize them in a better way, please feel free to contribute through the pull requests

I am finding these sources through Twitter, Google, Reddit, recommendations from friends, â€¦etc

Thanks for everyone who tries to open-source any learning materials
