# Courses

- [https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver) This one is one of the best but kinda old from 2015, but has all the fundamentals
[https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-series-2021](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-series-2021)  This is the newer version, it should be much better, it is easy at the beginning but then kinda hard from mathematics background
- [https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)  This is also really good and very organized and kinda interesting as they have practical projects
- [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)  The same comment as Udacity
- [https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) This one I felt is advanced but it is also good

# RL frameworks:

- [https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-1.5.0/rllib.html](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-1.5.0/rllib.html) (One of the best, but might be hard to customize for beginners) But it is really gooood
- [https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (Also, really good)
- https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL Seems good for working within the cloud and multi GPU, but did not try it
- https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt Some people used it, but for me seems that they are not developing in it anymore somehow
