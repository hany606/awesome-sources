# awesome-sources [Open Access]

This repository is created to share my list of sources that I usually find through the internet (Twitter, Google, Reddit, friends' recommendations, ...etc)

You can view this better in Notion (I really recommend that) https://hany606.notion.site/Open-Access-48bf22cbb0944f02a29c1177a8898c16

I will be always updating the Notion version and once in a while, I will push the updates here.

> I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, especially Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning I find it a very interesting research field with a lot of unanswered research questions.
> 

> At the current moment, I am trying to work on the intersection between RL (esp. MARL) and the motion planning problem in self-driving cars as a part of [VDC Lab](http://vdclab.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_2)

# Description:

> This is the original document for Open Access documents. I prefer using Notion as it is handy to be used with tables, links, …etc
> 

> I believe that open sourcing any knowledge is an important aspect that helps everyone to learn from others’ mistakes. Therefore, I am trying to document everything I find, so that I can help others as well and not fall into the same mistakes of mine.
